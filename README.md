# How To Use Vertex Gemini Vision Pro Generative AI To Inspect Image Details

This notebook outlines how to interact with Vertex AI's Gemini Vision Pro GenAI model to inspect images and generate detailed information about its content. Visual Question Answering (VQA) lets you provide an image to the model and ask a question about the image's contents. In response to your question you get one or more natural language answers.

This repo contains example notebooks for both the legacy Imagen modle and the new Gemini Vision Pro model.
